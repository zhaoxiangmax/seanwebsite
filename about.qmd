**Wise Health Home Medicines Review**, founded and led by accredited pharmacist **Sean Zhang**, provides personalised medication reviews designed to support both patients and their GPs.

Based in Brisbane, we proudly serve our local community by identifying medication-related risks, improving understanding of treatment plans, and ensuring every patient receives safe and effective therapy in the comfort of their own home.

Sean is fluent in Mandarin, offering clear and culturally responsive communication for patients who prefer consultations in that language.

Our mission is to leverage Sean’s more than ten years of frontline experience in medication services—combined with strong communication skills and clinical expertise—to help GPs and patients achieve better, safer, and more effective medical solutions.
